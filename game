Fizzbuzz is an exercise where the user must write a program to output all
n contained within the set of integers from 1..m where m is normally 100;
however, if the number is divisible by 3, instead of printing n, it prints fizz,
if the number is divisible by 5, it prints buzz, and if it is divisible by 15,
it prints fizzbuzz.

eg:

1
2
fizz
4
buzz
fizz
7
8
fizz
